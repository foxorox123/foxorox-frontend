  <h2>Market Context</h2>
  <p>AI spending in the U.S. has reached record highs, with most funds directed toward physical infrastructure rather than consumer products. Analysts note that while growth rates may decelerate after 2025, the cumulative investment levels will remain historically elevated. AI’s share of U.S. GDP has crossed 1%, marking a new phase of industrial-scale digital investment.</p>
  <p>Public sector spending, by contrast, remains modest (~$8.4B total federal contracts). The private sector continues to dominate AI financing, driven by competition for compute capacity and model performance leadership.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Outlook</h2>
  <p>The 2025–2026 outlook suggests stabilization in AI infrastructure outlays but acceleration in applied AI and automation tools. Enterprises are expected to shift focus from capacity building to monetization and efficiency gains. In the long term, AI capital intensity is expected to normalize, yet remain a central pillar of corporate investment strategy.

Foxorox estimates that such spending will never fully meet investor expectations, as part of the AI-related expenditures is likely financed by debt. Oracle would never be able to generate such an amount of free cash flow — the recently announced $300 billion AI infrastructure plan seems more like a product of imagination than necessity. After all, Oracle can easily outsource AI capabilities from its peers.

Such large-scale overinvestment leads only in one direction — north. We at Foxorox still remember the dot-com bubble of 2000 and how that ended. Good luck, Oracle… and the rest. Hehehe. </p>
