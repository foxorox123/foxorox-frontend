<div class="section">
  <h2>Welltower — Why the sentiment is turning bullish</h2>

  <p>
    Recent market commentary describes a <strong>bullish sentiment</strong> around Welltower,
    driven primarily by accelerating fundamentals in senior housing and a large-scale
    repositioning of the portfolio. While analyst opinions are not uniformly positive,
    the underlying operating data have improved materially versus prior years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Management recently <strong>raised full-year normalized FFO guidance</strong>, citing
    strong same-store NOI growth and improving occupancy trends in senior housing operating assets.
    This segment has become the core earnings engine for the company, supported by favorable
    demographic trends and limited new supply.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, Welltower has been actively recycling capital — selling non-core assets
    and redeploying into higher-growth senior housing portfolios in the U.S. and selected
    international markets. This strategy has reinforced the perception that Welltower is
    moving from a defensive healthcare REIT toward a more growth-oriented platform within
    the sector.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bullish narrative is not without friction. Some investment banks have recently shifted
    their rating to neutral after a strong share price run, arguing that much of the near-term
    upside is already priced in. Nevertheless, price targets across the street generally remain
    above current trading levels, reflecting confidence in medium-term cash flow growth.

  <h2>Welltower vs. healthcare REIT peers</h2>

  <p>
    Compared with other large healthcare REITs, Welltower stands out for its heavier exposure
    to senior housing operations and its more aggressive capital allocation strategy.
    Peers with higher dividend yields often trade on income stability, while Welltower
    increasingly trades on growth expectations.

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>
  <p>
    The current bullish sentiment around Welltower reflects a combination of
    <strong>strong operating momentum in senior housing</strong>,
    improved earnings visibility, and an active capital recycling strategy.
    While valuation is no longer cheap after a significant rally,
    the company continues to be viewed as one of the highest-quality growth
    platforms within the healthcare REIT space.

<!-- ================= GODADDY (FULL, EXPANDED) ================= -->

<div class="section">
  <h2>GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) — Full deep-dive: company, catalysts, risks, and industry positioning</h2>

  <p>
    GoDaddy sits at the intersection of “internet infrastructure for small businesses” (domains + hosting) and the
    application layer (websites, commerce, payments, email/marketing). The stock’s sentiment tends to be shaped less
    by pure top-line speed and more by a repeatable formula: steady mid-single to high-single digit growth, expanding
    operating leverage, and aggressive per-share value creation through buybacks funded by high free cash flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    The company’s latest quarterly report reinforces that framing. GoDaddy posted Q3 2025 revenue of
    <strong>$1.265B</strong>, with net income of <strong>$210.5M</strong>. On a non-GAAP basis, management reported
    <strong>NEBITDA margin of 32.3%</strong> and <strong>free cash flow of $440.5M</strong> for the quarter. For the
    full year 2025, management raised revenue guidance to <strong>$4.93B–$4.95B</strong> and reiterated a free cash
    flow outlook of approximately <strong>$1.6B</strong>, implying a very high cash conversion profile versus many
    software and internet peers.
  </p>

  <p>
    A key point for equity holders is how that cash is used. Year-to-date through late October 2025, GoDaddy repurchased
    <strong>9.0M shares</strong> for <strong>$1.4B</strong>. At the same time, the balance sheet remains levered but
    manageable in the context of cash generation: at quarter-end, cash was about <strong>$0.924B</strong>, total debt
    about <strong>$3.8B</strong>, and net debt about <strong>$2.9B</strong>. This is why the market often reads GoDaddy
    as a “cash compounder” rather than a hyper-growth story.
  </p>

  <h2>What the latest quarter says about the business mix</h2>

  <p>
    GoDaddy’s operating narrative is increasingly about mix-shift. Management breaks the business into
    <strong>Applications &amp; Commerce</strong> (website builder, commerce tools, payments, managed WordPress, etc.)
    and <strong>Core Platform</strong> (domains, hosting, productivity). In Q3 2025, segment economics highlighted the
    contrast: A&amp;C segment EBITDA was about <strong>$219.9M</strong> with a ~<strong>45.7%</strong> EBITDA margin,
    while Core Platform EBITDA was about <strong>$258.5M</strong> with a ~<strong>33.0%</strong> EBITDA margin.
    That spread is why investors care about A&amp;C growth; it drives margin durability and supports larger buybacks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Customer metrics show a mature platform with monetization lift rather than rapid user expansion. Customers at period
    end were about <strong>20.413M</strong> (slightly down year-over-year), while ARPU rose to about <strong>$237</strong>
    and annualized recurring revenue (ARR) to about <strong>$4.294B</strong>. That combination typically signals improved
    wallet-share and pricing discipline: fewer “headline” customer additions, but better value capture per customer.
  </p>

  <h2>Industry landscape: why the sector feels more “financialized” than before</h2>

  <p>
    The domain/hosting/SMB web presence market has been consolidating for years, but the pace of deal activity and
    private-equity involvement has become hard to ignore. A high-profile example in 2025 was the announced deal for
    Namecheap, one of GoDaddy’s recognizable competitors in domains and hosting, valued at roughly <strong>$1.5B</strong>
    including debt. Sector coverage linked the transaction to a broader wave of buyout activity across web hosting and
    SMB web tooling. This trend matters for GoDaddy because it changes competitive behavior: pricing can stabilize,
    marketing intensity can fluctuate, and product roadmaps can diverge depending on owners’ return targets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another theme is specialization and portfolio reshaping. In late 2025, a corporate-domain focused registrar
    acquired Markmonitor from Newfold Digital (owner of Bluehost and Network Solutions) in a $450M deal, while Newfold
    emphasized a sharper focus on mass-market web hosting and SMB tooling. This illustrates the “barbell” structure of the
    market: premium enterprise domain protection on one end, and mass SMB self-serve website creation on the other.
    GoDaddy primarily plays the mass SMB end, where product experience and upsell discipline matter more than bespoke
    enterprise services.
  </p>

  <h2>Competition in 2025: product velocity and AI-assisted creation are raising the bar</h2>

  <p>
    GoDaddy’s competitive set is not one single company; it is a mix of specialists. Wix is a direct competitor in website
    creation and increasingly in “build + run the business” tooling. In its Q3 2025 update, Wix reported that bookings and
    revenue growth accelerated to about <strong>14% y/y</strong> and highlighted rapid adoption of its AI-related Base44
    initiatives. Shopify sits in adjacent territory (commerce infrastructure rather than general SMB web presence), but its
    scale and ecosystem make it a strategic benchmark: Shopify reported Q3 2025 revenue growth of <strong>32%</strong> and
    an <strong>18%</strong> free cash flow margin, signaling strong execution and an ability to invest heavily while still
    generating substantial cash.
  </p>

  <p>
    The practical takeaway: customers increasingly expect “agentic” or AI-assisted setup and workflow automation.
    This raises switching pressure for providers that do not improve onboarding speed, conversion rates, and the
    “time-to-value” of websites and commerce tools. GoDaddy’s own messaging has leaned into this direction, including
    showcasing its AI experiences (Airo) at an investor event. In a maturing SMB market, user experience upgrades
    often matter more than raw feature count.
  </p>

  <h2>Valuation and market expectations (where sentiment tends to turn)</h2>

  <p>
    Because GoDaddy’s equity story is cash-heavy, investors commonly sanity-check valuation through
    <strong>EV/EBITDA</strong> and an “owner earnings” lens (free cash flow relative to enterprise value). On widely
    followed screens, GoDaddy’s EV/EBITDA sits in the mid-to-high teens, and the company shows levered free cash flow
    north of $1B on a trailing basis. The market is effectively paying for consistency, buybacks, and margin durability
    more than for a breakout growth cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The table below is designed to keep the comparison honest. It contrasts GoDaddy’s profile with two highly relevant
    benchmarks: Wix (direct web creation competitor) and Shopify (commerce infrastructure bellwether). The metrics are
    intentionally “apples-to-oranges aware”: Wix and Shopify will often trade at different levels because they have
    different growth, TAM exposure, and reinvestment profiles. The purpose is not to crown a winner, but to frame what
    GoDaddy needs to deliver for its current valuation to look attractive.

  </table>

  <h2>Key risks that can change the narrative (without being “existential”)</h2>

  <p>
    The most visible near-term headline risk is litigation. A Delaware jury ordered GoDaddy to pay <strong>$170M</strong>
    in a patent dispute related to website-building technology, and GoDaddy has said it plans to contest the verdict.
    For investors, the issue is less the absolute dollar amount than uncertainty about timing, appeal outcomes, and the
    possibility of follow-on claims. This type of headline can compress multiples even if the underlying operations
    continue to execute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Operationally, the “slow-burn” risk is competitive product velocity. If Wix, Shopify, and a growing set of AI-native
    tools reduce the friction of building and operating a site, GoDaddy needs to keep improving onboarding conversion,
    attach rates, and retention. A mature customer base with improving ARPU is good, but it also means incremental
    growth relies on continuous product upgrades and smart packaging rather than simply adding large numbers of new
    customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, there is capital allocation risk. GoDaddy’s buyback-driven per-share story works best when (a) free cash flow
    remains strong, (b) buybacks are executed at reasonable valuations, and (c) leverage stays comfortable. The market is
    typically forgiving if these remain aligned; it becomes less forgiving if FCF slips or if repurchases look mistimed.
  </p>

  <h2>What to watch over the next 2–4 quarters (the “earnings test”)</h2>

  <p>
    Most investors will focus on four recurring checkpoints. First: whether A&amp;C can keep growing in the teens while
    maintaining strong segment margins. Second: whether Core Platform remains stable despite churn pressure and the exit
    of the .CO registry contract headwind cited in guidance. Third: whether NEBITDA margin holds around the low 30s while
    product investment continues. Fourth: whether free cash flow lands near the ~$1.6B target and supports ongoing large
    repurchases without balance-sheet stress.
  </p>

  <h2>Bottom line</h2>

  <p>
    GoDaddy’s investment case in late 2025 is essentially a bet on durable SMB demand for “online presence + tools,”
    translated into a reliable stream of recurring revenue and high free cash flow. The industry backdrop is becoming
    more consolidated and more AI-driven, which raises the strategic bar but can also reduce irrational competition.
    If GoDaddy continues to lift ARPU, defend Core Platform stability, and grow Applications &amp; Commerce while
    sustaining ~32%+ EBITDA margin and strong cash conversion, the stock can justify a “quality compounder” valuation.
    The main narrative disruptors are legal uncertainty and any sign that competitor product velocity is eroding
    conversion/retention faster than GoDaddy can respond.
