  <h2>Qualcomm</h2>
  <p><b>Gap:</b> 38.27% &nbsp; <b>Candle:</b> 71.45% (black)</p>
  <p>Qualcomm shows bearish sentiment (71.45%, gap 38.27%). Qualcomm – Regulatory and Market Risks Cloud Near-Term Outlook

Qualcomm’s market sentiment has turned cautious as investors digest a series of regulatory and operational challenges that threaten to overshadow the company’s recent gains in AI and mobile chip segments. While the semiconductor giant remains one of the key enablers of 5G and AI-enabled smartphones, mounting headwinds in China and regulatory uncertainty are weighing on confidence.

The company recently admitted that it completed its acquisition of the Israeli automotive chipmaker Autotalks without notifying Chinese antitrust authorities, prompting an official investigation. This misstep has drawn scrutiny in one of Qualcomm’s most important markets, where nearly two-thirds of its handset revenues originate. The timing couldn’t be worse — U.S.-China trade tensions and tech export restrictions already make operations in the region fragile, and an additional probe adds legal and diplomatic risk to the company’s long-term positioning.

In Europe, Qualcomm’s legacy legal battles also continue to resurface. The EU Court recently reaffirmed a €238 million fine over historical predatory pricing practices, reminding investors of the company’s persistent exposure to antitrust and regulatory enforcement. Combined with 24 distinct risk factors disclosed in its recent filings — most prominently in the legal and innovation categories — this paints a picture of a company still navigating a complex compliance environment.

Operationally, Qualcomm is not immune to the cyclical slowdown in the smartphone sector. While recent quarterly results showed healthy revenue growth, profit margins have been pressured by a large non-cash tax charge and cautious guidance. Moreover, reports of potential licensing tensions with ARM over chip design rights have amplified investor unease about the durability of Qualcomm’s technology ecosystem.

Despite these challenges, Qualcomm remains strategically important in the global semiconductor landscape, especially in AI-capable mobile computing and automotive connectivity. However, the short-term narrative has clearly shifted: regulatory exposure, dependence on China, and margin pressure are keeping the stock in check. For now, Qualcomm’s future depends not only on technological leadership but also on its ability to navigate an increasingly politicized and tightly regulated global chip market.

  <h2>Broadcom</h2>
  <p><b>Gap:</b> 57.71% &nbsp; <b>Candle:</b> 64.03% (black)</p>
  <p>Broadcom shows bearish sentiment (64.03%, gap 57.71%). Broadcom – Overextension in the AI Boom Raises Investor Concerns

Broadcom’s meteoric rise as a major supplier of AI infrastructure components has drawn both admiration and anxiety from the market. Once known primarily for its dominance in networking and semiconductor design, the company has poured enormous capital into building custom AI accelerators and next-generation chips tailored for hyperscale data centers. This strategic shift has made Broadcom one of the key beneficiaries of the AI wave — but also one of its most overexposed players.

Recent quarters highlight a growing imbalance between ambition and sustainable growth. Despite strong revenue figures, Broadcom’s latest earnings guidance failed to excite investors, suggesting that AI-related growth may already be fully priced in. The company’s dependence on a handful of hyperscaler clients — including large cloud and AI companies — amplifies the risk: any delay, contract renegotiation, or spending slowdown by a single major partner could have an outsized impact on Broadcom’s results.

Analysts have also raised concerns that Broadcom’s heavy capital commitments to AI infrastructure could strain margins over the coming quarters. The intense competition in custom silicon, combined with the high cost of production and limited scalability of bespoke chip designs, leaves little room for execution errors. In essence, Broadcom appears to be running at full throttle just as the market begins questioning the profitability of large-scale AI hardware spending.

While the company’s leadership and engineering capabilities remain world-class, the short-term picture is clouded by valuation risk and potential overinvestment. Broadcom’s story today is one of innovation under pressure — a reminder that even the strongest players can overextend when chasing the next technological revolution.
