  <h2>Troubles in the Trucking Giant: What’s Really Going On at PACCAR?</h2>
  <p>
    PACCAR, the company behind Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF, is still printing solid profits,
    but the numbers from its latest reports show a business clearly coming off the peak of
    the last truck cycle. After a record 2023, 2024 full-year revenues slipped to about
    $33.7 billion from $35.1 billion and net income eased to roughly $4.2 billion from
    $4.6 billion, with return on equity falling from the mid-30s to the mid-20s. The first
    nine months of 2025 brought a further cooldown: net sales and financial services
    revenues dropped to around $21.6 billion versus more than $25.7 billion a year earlier,
    while reported net income was $1.8 billion and adjusted net income about $2.1 billion
    once a large civil-litigation charge in Europe is stripped out...
  </p>
  <p>
    The quarterly pattern tells the same story. In Q1 2025 PACCAR generated about
    $7.4 billion of revenue and just over $500 million of net income, down from roughly
    $8.7 billion and $1.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. Q2 2025 came in at
    $7.5 billion of revenue and about $724 million of net income, again below 2024 levels.
    Q3 2025 saw revenues fall to $6.7 billion from $8.2 billion a year earlier, with net
    income sliding from roughly $972 million to $590 million, even as truck deliveries
    remained strong at almost 32,000 units and PACCAR Parts posted record quarterly
    revenue of around $1.7 billion. Parts and Financial Services are cushioning the
    downturn, but the truck business is clearly normalizing from the 2023–2024 boom...
  </p>
  <p>
    On the balance-sheet and valuation side, PACCAR still looks like one of the higher-quality
    names in global trucks. Its 2024 return on beginning equity was in the mid-20% range,
    supported by an asset-light truck model and a profitable captive finance arm with more
    than $22 billion of assets. Leverage at the consolidated level is moderate, with
    debt-to-equity around 0.9×, largely tied to the Financial Services portfolio rather
    than the industrial business. In the market, the stock currently trades on a
    price-to-earnings multiple a little above 20× and offers roughly a 1–1.5% dividend yield
    from its regular quarterly payout, occasionally topped up by special dividends. That
    combination — high ROE and a premium P/E — tells you investors still view PACCAR as a
    quality compounder, not a deep-value cyclical...
  </p>
  <p>
    The backdrop, however, has turned tougher for the entire heavy-truck universe.
    Daimler Truck, the global volume leader, saw 2024 unit sales fall about 12% and group
    revenue dip to roughly €54 billion, with adjusted industrial margins slipping from
    just under 10% to the high-8% range and a multi-year cost-cutting plan now underway
    in Europe. Volkswagen’s truck arm Traton reported 2024 sales revenue of about
    €47.5 billion and an adjusted operating margin a bit above 9%, but is also guiding
    for a much softer truck market in 2025 and has started cutting production at some
    plants as demand cools. Across Europe and North America, order books are normalizing
    after the post-pandemic surge, while new emissions rules, electrification spending and
    tariff noise are pushing costs higher and making planning harder for fleets and OEMs
    alike...
  </p>
  <p>
    PACCAR’s own commentary acknowledges those pressures. Management is dealing with a
    sizeable non-recurring legal charge in Europe, navigating new U.S. Section 232 truck
    tariffs and preparing for lower-margin electric and low-emission products — all while
    trying to hold pricing and protect profitability. The company’s response is to lean
    into its strengths: premium brands, high-margin aftermarket parts, a disciplined
    finance arm and ongoing capex and R&amp;D in cleaner powertrains, connected services
    and AI-driven uptime tools. Fundamentally, PACCAR is not a broken story — but it is
    in the difficult part of the cycle, where revenue growth is slowing, margins are under
    pressure, and investors are being asked to pay a quality multiple for earnings that
    may be past their peak. Whether that premium holds will depend on how well PACCAR can
    manage the downcycle, execute on cost and technology investments, and keep outgrowing
    peers like Daimler Truck and Traton on returns, not just volumes...

<!-- ===== SEKCJA PEPSICO ===== -->

<div class="section">
  <h2>PepsiCo</h2>
  <p><b>Gap:</b> 7.08% &nbsp; <b>Candle:</b> 63.84% (black)</p>
  <p>PepsiCo shows bearish sentiment (63.84%, gap 7.08%).</p>

  <h2>PepsiCo Under Pressure: What the Numbers Say About Its Reset</h2>
  <p>
    PepsiCo is still a revenue giant – in 2024 it generated almost $92 billion in net revenue
    and roughly $9.6 billion in net income, with a solid net margin of about 10% and an
    operating margin near 14%. That’s not a broken business by any stretch, but growth has
    clearly cooled: reported sales were barely up versus 2023, cash from operations actually
    fell year-on-year, and the core North American food and beverage units have been losing
    momentum as consumers push back against years of price increases...
  </p>
  <p>
    The latest quarterly numbers show the same pattern. In Q3 2025 PepsiCo delivered about
    $23.9 billion in revenue, up roughly 2.7% versus a year earlier and slightly ahead of
    Wall Street expectations, while core earnings per share of $2.29 beat consensus by
    three cents. That is “good enough” in headline terms, but underneath you see a business
    relying heavily on pricing and mix, with modest volume growth and softer demand in some
    key North American snack and soda categories. For a company that once routinely posted
    mid-single-digit organic growth, a roughly 1–2% pace over the first nine months of 2025
    is a noticeable downshift...
  </p>
  <p>
    This slowdown is what drew activist investor Elliott into the story with an estimated
    $4 billion stake and a push for faster, sharper execution. Under pressure, PepsiCo has
    now agreed to a broad reset: cutting prices on selected products, shutting several
    long-standing plants, and removing around 20% of its U.S. SKUs to simplify the portfolio
    and free up manufacturing and shelf space. The plan is to focus more tightly on core
    brands and formats, clean up ingredients, push “functional” propositions like protein-
    fortified snacks and prebiotic colas, and then recycle the savings into stronger
    marketing and in-store execution. Management is guiding for 2–4% organic revenue
    growth and mid-single-digit core EPS growth in 2026, alongside at least 100 basis
    points of core operating margin expansion over the next few years – ambitious targets
    for a company that has just admitted it needs a strategic shake-up...
  </p>
  <p>
    Fundamentally, though, PepsiCo still has the financial profile of a defensive compounder.
    In 2024 it produced over $50 billion of gross profit on that ~$92 billion revenue base,
    sustaining a mid-50s gross margin, and almost $12.9 billion of operating income. The
    balance sheet is manageable, with leverage anchored by highly cash-generative snack and
    beverage franchises, and the company remains a dividend stalwart with more than five
    decades of consecutive dividend increases and a forward yield around the high-3% range.
    On 2024 numbers the stock trades on roughly a low-20s price-to-earnings multiple – not
    cheap for a low-growth consumer staple, but in line with a “quality plus yield” story
    that many long-term investors still like...
  </p>
  <p>
    Against its peers, the picture is mixed. Coca-Cola is smaller on revenue but richer on
    margins, converting about $47 billion of 2024 sales into operating margins above 21%
    and offering a near-3% dividend yield, while Nestlé sits in a similar revenue league to
    PepsiCo with roughly CHF 91 billion of sales and a trading operating margin around 16%.
    Mondelez, more focused on biscuits and chocolate, is leaner again, with roughly
    $36 billion of revenue but a high-teens operating margin. In that context, PepsiCo looks
    like a scale leader whose profitability sits between pure-play drinks and premium
    global food names – but whose recent growth lag and need for activist-driven change
    highlight that scale alone is no longer enough. The next phase will be about proving
    that a simpler, more focused PepsiCo can grow faster, earn more, and finally close
    the valuation and performance gap to its best-in-class rivals...
